      Number using O5 output only:               2
      Number using O5 and O6:                   29
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  58,400    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    72 out of  37,680    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          194
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           111 out of     194   57%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  20 out of     194   10%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          63 out of     194   32%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              12 out of 301,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
